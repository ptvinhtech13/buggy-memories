> *"Do anything about Software Industry"*

Hey there! I'm a seasoned **Software Engineer, Leader, and Founder** with **8 years of experience** navigating the dynamic world of software development. I thrive on tackling challenges head-on, from architecting robust systems to leading high-performing teams.

I've had the opportunity to work stateside twice as a key liaison for Vietnam-based teams, sharpening my communication and cross-cultural collaboration skills. My passion lies in building scalable solutions from the ground up, having successfully launched **Three Java Microservices Platforms** from scratch. I'm also the proud **Founder of BargeConnect and VinTa Software Solutions**.
